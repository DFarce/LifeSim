LifeH specification

Goals:
-mimic the resource consumption of organisms
-mimic the conversion of resources from one form to another
-Create a simple genetic code that can be modified through selective 
    processes


Specification:

FIELD:
The playing field has a set of squares that each can contain resources 
which and which is in contact with its adjacent squares.

CELLS:
Each cell has a "computer" and a set of resource stacks. Each resource 
stack is a list of signed integers (undecided height and width). The 
resources are referred to as 'val's (values). A val is a number, a coding 
segment, and finally a unit of energy. Performing some operations will 
the use of a val to perform, similar to chemical reactions. A val can be 
likened to a chemical.

The stacks are all identical, except for the input stack. At the beginning 
each step, the input stack is erased in each cell and replaced by a number 
of random vals, which represents the energy introduced by the sun in this 
system.

CODE EXECUTION:
A certain code is considered the RUNNABLE flag. Of the stacks beginning 
with the RUNNABLE flag, a random one is selected to be run at each step 
(the running stack, and the program counter are stored in the cell). This 
provides a simple way to allow competition between cells. A program can 
be parasitic to other cells by pushing an extra code to nearby cells. 

To help with positional advantage, one line of code is run from all the 
cells at a time and in random order. This prevents any singular cell from 
getting an early advantage. 

CODES:
Val access
Name    cost    
LOAD    0       Loads a cell into memory
SET     0       Sets memory to a certain value
POP     0       Shifts one val to a dfferent stack
CONV    1       Converts one val to a different value
CPUSH   2       Shifts one val to a different stack in a different cell
CPOP    2       Shifts one val from a different cell to this cell
